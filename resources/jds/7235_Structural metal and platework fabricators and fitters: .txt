Study engineering drawings and blueprints, determine the materials required, and plan the sequence of tasks to cut metal most efficiently. Construct patterns and templates as guides for layouts. Lay out reference points and patterns on heavy metal according to component specifications. Rig, hoist and move materials to storage areas or within worksite. Assemble and fit metal sections and plates to form complete units or subunits using tack welding, bolting, riveting or other methods. Set up and operate various heavy-duty metal-working machines such as brake presses, shears, cutting torches, grinders and drills, including computer numerical control (CNC) equipment, to bend, cut, form, punch, drill or otherwise form heavy-metal components. Install fabricated components in final product.
