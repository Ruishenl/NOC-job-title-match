Check train systems and equipment such as air conditioning and heating systems, brakes and brake hoses prior to train run. Communicate with train crew members by radio, signals or by other means to aid in the movement and operation of train. Receive orders from traffic controllers, observe signals and track conditions and open and close track switches. Set and release hand brakes and connect air brake hoses to couple and switch passenger or freight cars, making minor repairs to couplings, air hoses and wheel-bearing boxes as required. Assist in collecting fares and helping passengers on and off train.
