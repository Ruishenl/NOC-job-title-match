Read and interpret engineering drawings, blueprints, charts and tables or study sample parts to determine machining operation to be performed, and plan best sequence of operations. Compute dimensions and tolerances and measure and lay out work pieces. Set up, operate and maintain a variety of machine tools including computer numerically controlled (CNC) tools to perform precision, non-repetitive machining operations such as sawing, turning, milling, boring, planing, drilling, precision grinding and other operations. Fit and assemble machined metal parts and subassemblies using hand and power tools. Verify dimensions of products for accuracy and conformance to specifications using precision measuring instruments. May set up and program machine tools for use by machining tool operators.
