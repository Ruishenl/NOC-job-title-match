Inspect electronic components and assemblies to ensure correct component selection and placement, wiring and soldering quality, proper pin insertions, location and diameter of plated holes, breaks in circuitry and line spacing in printed circuit board and other specified requirements while products are being assembled or fabricated. Check final assembly for finish, labelling and packaging methods. Check mechanical dimensions and perform "go-no-go" electrical tests. Identify and mark acceptable and defective assemblies and return faulty assemblies to production for repair. Collect, record and summarize inspection results. Investigate equipment malfunction and instruct on proper operation.
