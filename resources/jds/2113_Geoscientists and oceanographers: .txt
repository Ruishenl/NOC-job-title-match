Conduct theoretical and applied research to extend knowledge of surface and subsurface features of the earth, its history and the operation of physical, chemical and biological systems that control its evolution. Plan, direct and participate in geological, geochemical and geophysical field studies, drilling and geological testing programs. Plan and conduct seismic, geodetic, electromagnetic, magnetic, gravimetric, radiometric, radar and other remote sensing programs. Plan, direct and participate in analyses of geological, geochemical and geophysical survey data, well logs and other test results, maps, notes and cross sections. Develop models and applied software for the analysis and interpretation of data. Plan and conduct analytical studies of core samples, drill cuttings and rock samples to identify chemical, mineral, hydrocarbon and biological composition and to assess depositional environments and geological age. Assess the size, orientation and composition of mineral ore bodies and hydrocarbon deposits. Identify deposits of construction materials and determine their characteristics and suitability for use as concrete aggregates, road fill or for other applications. Conduct geological and geophysical studies for regional development and advise in areas such as site selection, waste management and restoration of contaminated sites. Recommend the acquisition of lands, exploration and mapping programs and mine development. Identify and advise on anticipated natural risks such as slope erosion, landslides, soil instability, subsidence, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. May supervise and co-ordinate well drilling, completion and work-overs and mining activities.
