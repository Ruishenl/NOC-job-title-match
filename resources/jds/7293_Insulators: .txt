Measure and cut insulating material to required dimensions using hand and power tools. Apply and secure insulation using spraying, blowing, pasting, strapping, taping and other application and installation methods. Fit insulation around obstructions and between studs and joists. Install vapour barriers. Apply waterproofing cement over insulating materials to finish surfaces. Remove asbestos or urea-formaldehyde insulation from buildings when required.
