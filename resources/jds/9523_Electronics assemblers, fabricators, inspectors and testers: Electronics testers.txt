Operate various test equipment and tools to perform simple electrical and continuity testing of electronic components, parts and systems. Set up and operate automatic testing equipment to locate circuit and wiring faults, shorts and component defects. Compare test results to specifications and set parts or products aside for repair or replace components or parts as indicated by test equipment. May conduct life tests (burn-ins) on components, subassemblies and assemblies. Maintain test result reports.
