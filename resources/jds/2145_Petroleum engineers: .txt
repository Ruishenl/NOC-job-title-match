Conduct  feasibility assessment studies for developing new oil and gas fields. Direct and monitor oil and gas drilling operations. Develop drilling programs, select sites and specify drilling fluids, bit selection, drill stem testing procedures and equipment. Direct and monitor the completion and evaluation of wells, well testing and well surveys. Design and select artificial lift machinery, and well and surface production equipment and systems, and specify programs for corrosion control and oil or gas treatment. Develop specifications for and monitor and supervise well modification and stimulation programs to maximize oil and gas recovery. Analyze reservoir rock and fluid data to design optimum recovery methods and to predict reservoir performance and reserves. Monitor and forecast oil and gas reservoir performance and recommend oil recovery techniques which extend the economic life of wells. Design, develop and co-ordinate the installation, maintenance and operation of subsea well-head and production equipment.
