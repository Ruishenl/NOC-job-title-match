Operate gas or oil fired furnaces to heat metal to proper temperature prior to forging. Place metal pieces in furnace using hand tongs or overhead cranes and remove from furnace when colour of metal indicates proper forging temperature, or load and unload furnace with automatic conveyor. Position heated or cold metal pieces, on die of press or other forging machinery. Operate presses or other forging machines to perform hot or cold forging by flattening, straightening, twisting, forming, drawing, upsetting, splitting, cutting, punching, piercing, bending, coining, or other operations to shape or form metal. Position and adjust dies on anvil of forging machinery using overhead cranes or other hoisting devices and hand tools.
