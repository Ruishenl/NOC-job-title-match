Review patient's case history and assess nature of problem to determine procedures and tests required. Attach diagnostic equipment to patients and ensure their comfort and safety. Operate diagnostic equipment such as electroencephalographic and evoked potential equipment to record the electrical activity of the brain and cranial and central nervous systems. Operate electromyographic equipment to conduct electrophysiological nerve conduction velocity tests and to assist physicians in conducting electrophysiological tests such as muscle strength and repetitive stimulation. Take notes on the recorded graph to identify interference such as poor electrode contact or patient movement. Prepare recordings and reports of findings for physicians to aid in the diagnosis of neurological disorders. Check, calibrate and perform routine maintenance of diagnostic equipment. Train and supervise students, technicians or other electroencephalograph technologists.
