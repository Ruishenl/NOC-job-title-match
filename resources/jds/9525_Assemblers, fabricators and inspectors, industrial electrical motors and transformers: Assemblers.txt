Assemble and fit metal and other prefabricated parts to close tolerances according to blueprints to build heavy-duty electric motors or transformers. Assemble stators or armatures for heavy-duty electric motors; compress steel laminations to build transformer cores; assemble windings into core using overhead cranes and make electrical connections using crimping, brazing and soldering equipment. Assemble and fit electrical motor or transformer auxiliary equipment such as bushings, tap changes, conduit boxes, heating devices, protective equipment and cooling equipment. Set up and adjust production machinery and equipment, such as coil winding machines, for the manufacture of heavy-duty electrical equipment. May perform basic tests on electric motors.
