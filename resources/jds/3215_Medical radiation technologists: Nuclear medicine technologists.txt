Prepare and administer radiopharmaceuticals, such as radionuclides and other tracer materials to patients or to biological samples. Operate radiation detection equipment, such as gamma cameras, scanners, scintillation counters, tomodensitometers and ionization chambers, to acquire data for use by nuclear medicine physicians in the diagnosis of disease. Perform diagnostic procedures using radioactive materials on biological specimens, such as blood, urine and faeces. Record and process results of procedures. Check equipment to ensure proper operation. Provide appropriate care and monitoring of the patient during the examination. Apply radiation protection measures. May train and supervise student nuclear medicine technologists or supervise other nuclear medicine technologists.
