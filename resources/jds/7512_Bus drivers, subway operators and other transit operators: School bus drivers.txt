Drive school buses to transport children between school and home or on excursions. Ensure children's safety when boarding and leaving buses and crossing street while bus is stopped. Maintain control of student activities during travel to prevent distractions or behaviours that could compromise safety. May transport adults outside of school hours on chartered trips.
