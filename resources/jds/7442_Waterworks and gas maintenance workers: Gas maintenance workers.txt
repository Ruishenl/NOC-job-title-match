Check and lubricate gas pipeline valves. Conduct routine survey of gas mains and distribution lines to detect and locate escaping gas using gas detecting devices. Investigate reports of gas leaks to determine the exact location and extent of leaks. Dig ground to expose gas lines and repair damaged pipes. Keep record of work performed and location and condition of pipelines. Provide information on underground gas distribution lines and observe excavation work to ensure that underground gas facilities are protected.
