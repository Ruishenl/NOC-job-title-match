Set up and calibrate non-destructive testing equipment. Conduct tests to ensure quality or detect discontinuities (defects) using ultrasonic, radiographic, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, eddy current and other non-destructive testing methods. Establish techniques for proper examination of objects under inspection, ensuring strict adherence to safety regulations. Interpret radiographs, cathode ray tube (CRT) or digital readouts, conductivity meters and visual indicators. Apply testing criteria in accordance with applicable specifications or standards and evaluate results. Organize and report test results. May perform specialized inspections using acoustic emission, vibration analysis, infrared thermography and laser shearography testing methods. May instruct and supervise trainees.
