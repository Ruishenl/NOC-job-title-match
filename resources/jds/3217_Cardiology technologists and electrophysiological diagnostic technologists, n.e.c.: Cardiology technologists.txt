Operate electrocardiogram and other electronic equipment to record cardiac activity of patients. Perform non-invasive cardiovascular procedures and tests, such as electrocardiograms, exercise tolerance tests, ambulatory monitoring and scanning of tapes, holter arrhythmia scanning, pacemaker analysis and follow-up. Record and assess cardiac activity and provide preliminary reports of tests. Provide patients with care during procedures and tests. Prepare reports for interpretation by cardiologists. Reprogram pacemakers according to required standards. Check, calibrate and perform routine maintenance of cardiology equipment to ensure proper operation. May analyze tests and notify physician or other health care professionals of abnormalities. May administer certain drugs under direct supervision of physician. May document and record pacemaker implant threshold measurements under direct supervision of cardiac surgeon. May supervise and train students, other cardiology technologists and nurses.
