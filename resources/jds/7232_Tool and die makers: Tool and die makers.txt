Read and interpret engineering drawings and specifications of tools, dies, prototypes or models. Prepare templates and sketches, and determine work processes. Compute dimensions and tolerances and set up machine tools. Position, secure, measure and work metal stock or castings to lay out for machining. Set up, operate and maintain a variety of conventional and computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools to cut, turn, mill, plane, drill, bore, grind or otherwise shape workpiece to prescribed dimensions and finish. Verify machined parts for conformance to specifications using precision measuring instruments such as verniers, callipers, micrometers, co-ordinate measuring machines (CMM) and electronic measuring devices. Fit and assemble or disassemble parts using hand tools. Test completed tools, dies, jigs or fixtures for proper operation. May program CNC machine tools.
