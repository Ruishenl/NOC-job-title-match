Study job orders and interpret blueprints to determine machining operations to be performed. Set up and operate machine tools to perform repetitive machining operations, such as turning, milling, drilling, boring, planing, honing, broaching, grinding or other machining operations. Verify dimensions of parts machined using micrometers, callipers and other precision measuring instruments. Prepare etching solution and immerse metal parts or workpiece in etching solution to remove unwanted portions. Perform routine maintenance on equipment and machinery. May enter codes specifying speed, feed and cut of the toolpath for computer numerical controlled (CNC) machine tools.
