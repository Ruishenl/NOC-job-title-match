Under the supervision of audiologists, administer tests such as pure tone hearing screening, impedance tests and noise level measurements using equipment such as audiometers and sound level meters to determine hearing thresholds of patients. Instruct patients on test procedures and record results. Monitor, check and calibrate auditory equipment. May take earmold impressions and fit and adjust hearing instruments.
