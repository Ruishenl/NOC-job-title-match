Plan, develop and co-ordinate programs of geotechnical, geological, geophysical or geohydrological data acquisition, analysis and mapping to assist in the development of civil engineering, mining, petroleum and waste management projects or for regional development. Analyze and prepare recommendations and reports for construction or improvements to foundations of civil engineering projects such as rock excavation, pressure grouting and hydraulic channel erosion control. Analyze and prepare recommendations and reports on settlement of buildings, stability of slopes and fills, and probable effects of landslides and earthquakes to support construction and civil engineering projects. Conduct theoretical and applied study of groundwater flow and contamination and develop prescriptions for site selection, treatment and construction. Plan, develop, co-ordinate and conduct theoretical and experimental studies in mining exploration, mine evaluation and feasibility studies relative to the mining industry. Conduct surveys and studies of ore deposits, ore reserve calculations and mine design. Design, develop and implement computer applications for geophysics, geochemistry, geology, mapping and related fields. Supervise technologists, technicians and other engineers and scientists.
